# Issues: 
1. There are some areas where I used both justify-content and align-items even though it didn't seem like using both was making a difference (maybe because I used VH/VW for a lot of padding, etc.?). Should I use both just to be safe even if one seems to have no effect?
2. Having issues getting the quote text to be light, even using !important and added specificity hasn't worked
3. Originally used VW/VH a lot for padding and other sizing, but decided not to since it would cause things to grow at different paces. Is flex 1 a better alternative?
